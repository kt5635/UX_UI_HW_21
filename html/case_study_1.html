            The goal of this project was create a yard sale app that will help
            buyers looking for second hand items, find information about
            specific items for sale at local yard sales. We took this project
            from an idea and turned it into a mid-fidelity prototype

        <h3>Anonymous survey</h3>
        <p>
          We sent out an anonymous that got 137 responses. We were looking for
          general information about how often someone might visit a yard sale,
          as well as what factors are important when shopping second-hand.

            90% of people find weekends the most convenient time to visit a yard

            Based on the information from the survey, we conducted five 1-1
            interviews. The focus of these interviews was to find information on
            how a shopper would find a yard sale and ways to make the experience
            more enjoyable.
